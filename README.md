#My MacOS Dotfiles üñ•Ô∏è

What are dotfiles?
Dotfiles are configuration files for Unix systems. They're used to store settings/preferences for command line tools, applications, and services, and are especially used to customize the behavior/appearance of the user's environment.

These are the dotfiles for my setup

Below are references to the tools that I use.
